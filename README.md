For this Product Landing Page project. I will be building a homepage similar to many of the subscription web pages we see today. Such as subscription based webpages like: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and VPN services.

I will be using flexbox, grid, spacing out texts, remove text decorations. properly label selectors for css usage, form only allows proper format otherwise error pops up .
